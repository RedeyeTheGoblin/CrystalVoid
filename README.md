CrystalVoid
===========

This is the configuration files and ID mapping for my Resonant Rise server, CrystalVoid.

The server is primarily to be used to record my Let's Play on, and is not currently open for applications. 
I may, however, choose to invite players to the server to play\record alongside me.
Please don't ask if you can join, I'll ask you. Asking will remove you from consideration entirely.
